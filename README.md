# Deep Learning Protocol

A conceptual C# implementation inspired by a hierarchical deep learning architecture diagram.

## Structure
- **AbstractCore**: Deepest reasoning layer (maroon node)
- **State Interface**: Top-level state management
- **Depth Interface**: Hierarchical processing layers
- **Aim Interface**: Goal-directed processing in spiral layers
- **DeepLearningProtocol**: Integrates all components with recursive deepening

## How to run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `DeepLearningProtocol.sln` in Visual Studio (or use `dotnet run` in the project folder)
3. Build and run — you'll see sample output demonstrating the full protocol flow.

## Diagram inspiration
The class design mirrors this conceptual diagram:

(state → depth → aim → abstract core with recursive orbit-like processing)

Feel free to extend with neural network integrations, async processing, or more layers!

## Running Unit Tests
1. Install dependencies: `dotnet restore`
2. Run tests: `dotnet test`
3. See 100% coverage on core methods!
